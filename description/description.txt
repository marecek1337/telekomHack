This analysis focuses on the death counts due to COVID-19 throughout different dates. By normalizing the data where necessary, we ensure each visual illustrates the data's variations effectively. The line graph shows a clear trend over time, while the scatter plot and bar chart offer insights into the data points' distribution. The box plot visually summarizes the distribution and potential outliers in the dataset, and the histogram showcases the frequency distribution. These detailed visual analyses provide data scientists with comprehensive insights into mortality trends during the pandemic period.
